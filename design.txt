## Introduction

This is busroutes.in done right, but not so right that it'll never ship. It is designed with the following goals in mind:

1. Make it easy for anyone to start an instance for their own city.
2. Make the entire data *user editable*, so that minor edits are absolutely painless.
3. Have an API + several clients (web/mobile/sms), so that work does not get repeated
4. Make it easy to keep data in sync with official sources, in cases where official sources are actually provided

We've picked **GTFS** to be the standard data import/export format, and **GeoJSON** to be the API transport format.

## API

The API provides read/write access to the data, along with routing information. People need to be logged in to make write calls to the API. The API design should be as minimal as possible, and hide all implementation details.
